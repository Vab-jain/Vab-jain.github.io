Hi, my name is Vaibhav Jain. I am a Master’s student at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html), enrolled in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence ([DSAI](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/master/data-science.html)) program. Since January 2023, I have also been working as a student researcher in the Smart Service Engineering ([SSE](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/smart-service-engineering)) group at DFKI Saarbrücken. My current thesis focuses on improving Reinforcement Learning using Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition, I am working on energy-efficient AI and its applications in the ESCADE project at DFKI.

I completed my Bachelor’s degree at the Cluster Innovation Center, University of Delhi. For my Bachelor’s thesis, I worked with [Dr. Santiago Mazuelas](https://www.bcamath.org/en/people/bcam-members/smazuelas) at BCAM in Bilbao, Spain, where I focused on the impact of covariate shift on a 0-1 loss min-max model.

I am a curious person who enjoys continuously learning and exploring new interests. I love discussing a wide range of topics and always appreciate a good conversation. My hobbies include cooking, going to the gym, playing piano and volleyball, and reading books. I have recently started exploring philosophy and welcome any suggestions!
